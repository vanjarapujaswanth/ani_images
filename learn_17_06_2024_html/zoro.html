                <p>Zoro has devoted his life to becoming the world's strongest swordsman. Even before joining the crew, he was well-renowned for his outstanding 
                    abilities and accomplishments in battle. His skills drastically improved after becoming the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates and entering a 
                    two-year training period under the "Strongest Swordsman in the World", Dracule Mihawk.[20]

                    By the time he met Luffy, Zoro had established himself as a fearsome bounty hunter in the East Blue, so much so that Koby had heard he was a 
                    "demon in the form of a man". His accomplishments in hunting pirates were significant enough to earn him the epithet of "Pirate Hunter", which 
                    he remains known for even after becoming a pirate.[9][21] After his crushing loss to Dracule Mihawk, he vowed never to lose again.[22] Since joining 
                    the crew, Zoro has defeated several mighty adversaries (most of whom are fellow swordsmen).
                    
                    Alongside Luffy and Sanji, Zoro is considered one of the Monster Trio (怪物三人組, Kaibutsu San-ningumi?) of the Straw Hats due to his strength.
                    [23][24] In some instances, he has even been mistaken as the leader of the Straw Hats due to his more extensive reputation; onlookers have also 
                    wondered how he could not be the captain after seeing demonstrations of his power.[25] During the crew's journey, Zoro has come to possess 
                    some of the most legendary swords in history and has used them to both improve his skills and develop the most devastating attacks.[26]
